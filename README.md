# About-myself
Don't be rude about it.

I'm a C++ programmer (experience -> about a month(not so much)). Let's say it like I'm a rookie in this enviroment. I know English, German, Ukranian and Russian. I'm looking forward to extend my C++ knowledge. I'm open to collaborate with someboddy, who needs a help
in C++ enviroment.
