# About-myself
Don't be rude about it.

I'm a C++ programmer (experience -> about a month(not so much)). Let's say it like I'm a rookie in this environment. I know English, German, Ukrainian, and Russian.
I'm looking forward to extending my C++ knowledge. I'm open to collaborating with somebody, who needs help in a C++ environment. I appreciate your feedback on my works, if you don't mind write me your feedback under my works.
